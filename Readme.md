# Children of the Night

Mod for Crusader Kings 2 that features alternate history 
Muslim Vampires and Pagan Werewolves.

## Alternate History

We were on the run. Our Christian brethen denounced us.
The Jews closed their gates on us.
This power, this thirst... we don't want any of it.

In the night, we traverse the earth, looking for new light.
Until we meet a man, The Prophet, who gave us place to
live, to enjoy what it meant to be family, under the Great
God.

He who doesn't judge us. Allowed us to stand together in
prayer. Travelling together during pilgrimate.

O' Great Prophet...

We pledge to protect you, your children, your people, till
the end of time...
